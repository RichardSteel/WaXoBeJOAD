			detail: 'We teach the sport of archery, mainly recurve, but also compound, to children and young adults aged 8 to 18. We focus on the NTS method of teaching and our lessons last one hour and start with a warm-up practice conducted by some of our more experienced and competitive archers. This is followed by  shooting practice which is observed by both the coaches and the advanced students. Occasionally, a single student or small group is taken to one side for a specific teaching lesson before they move back into shooting practice. Our teaching session lasts 8 weeks and we have 4 sessions in a year. After the fourth week of a session we hold a 300 round shoot and the student\â€™s score is recorded. It is through these 300 shoots that the student can earn JOAD achievement pins. Two shoots are required to obtain a pin, so students can get one pin per session, if their scores are high enough.'
